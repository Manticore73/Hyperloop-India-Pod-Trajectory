The scripts in this branch were used to calculate the trajectory by assuming the pod mass = 250kg and 300kg. 
The net acceleration by the pusher is assumed = 2g.
The .mat files are necessary variables to be loaded before the trajectory calculation.
Both normal braking and emergency braking scenarios were considered.
